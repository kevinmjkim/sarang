    <h1>Information About My Dog </h1>
    <p> My dog's name is Sarang which means love in Korean. He acts like cats and
        is scared of absolutely everything you could ever imagine. He hates 
        thunderstorms and whines 24/7 until the storm stops. Recently, we forced
        him to get a sedative because of his <strong><i>restless</i></strong> attitude. 
    </p>

    <h2>His Identity</h2>
<p> He is a mix of Parson Terrier Mix and Jack Russell Terrier Mix. His head the 
    is a pattern of an oreo with black polka dots on his very white fur. He loves
    his lifestyle of resting just resting. Does nothing from dawn to dusk except
    sleeping and eating and sometimes using the restroom.
